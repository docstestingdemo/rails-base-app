## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `login` function in the provided code snippet:

The `login` function is an asynchronous operation that sends a POST request to authenticate a user. It takes a `user` object of type `IUserLogin` as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an AxiosResponse. The function sends the user's login credentials to the server endpoint 'users/login' using an HTTP POST request. The server then processes the login attempt and sends back a response, which is ultimately returned by this function.
