Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `login` function in the provided code snippet:

The `login` function is an asynchronous operation that sends a POST request to authenticate a user. It takes a `user` object of type `IUserLogin` as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an AxiosResponse. The function sends the user's login credentials to the server endpoint 'users/login' using an HTTP POST request. The server then processes the login attempt and sends back a response, which is ultimately returned by this function.

# logout app/javascript/apis/auth.api.ts
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `logout` function in the provided code snippet:

The `logout` function is an asynchronous operation that sends a DELETE request to the 'users/logout' endpoint of an API. It uses an HTTP client (likely Axios, given the `AxiosResponse` type) to perform this request. When called, it initiates the logout process on the server-side, typically invalidating the user's session or token. The function returns a Promise that resolves with the response from the server, allowing the calling code to handle the logout result asynchronously.
